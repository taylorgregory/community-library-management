# intro-to-algorithms
Implementation of several basic sorting and searching algorithms in C#. Featured algorithms include:

1) SequentialSearch - Searches for a given value in a given array by sequential search
2) ArrayMax - Returns the value of the largest number in a given array
3) IsSorted - Returns true if all the numbers in a given array are sorted in ascending order
4) MinDistance - Returns the separation of
5) ReverseArray -
6) BinarySearch -
7) InsertionSort -

.... etc.
